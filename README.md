dotfiles
========
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Curious about my setup?
My system is reliant upon the
[Mac App Store](https://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store/),
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh), [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io), and
[oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh).

After reviewing many different public dotfile systems, frameworks, and dotfile
utilities such as those summarized on the [unofficial guide to dotfiles on
GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io), I discovered the simplicity offered by a
single tool called Cider that saves and restores your Homebrew and Homebrew
Cask setup as well as saving and restoring ~ symlinks.

My dotfiles are managed via [Cider](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cider/), a
hassle-free bootstrapping python tool using Homebrew.
